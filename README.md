This repo consists of my personal solutions solved by me on GeeksforGeeks.
Structured by topics : Arrays
Today on 30th of june i started practising array problems after being watched all the striver's videos for month regarding arrays.Today i solved largest element and the problem is return the element which exists more than half of the size of the array and if it doesnot then return -1.So i used unordered map to solve this.
